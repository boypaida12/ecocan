                We at ECOCAN are on the forefront of championing this DRS
                revolution in developing markets where it is needed the most.
                But numerous bottlenecks have been hindering implementation,
                until now. Leveraging our advanced technologies and extensive
                recycling experience, we&apos;ve overcome those prohibitive
                barriers. By tailoring a DRS to developing markets&apos;
                environment, made it over 70% cheaper to set up, and slashed
                administration cost by millions of dollars
