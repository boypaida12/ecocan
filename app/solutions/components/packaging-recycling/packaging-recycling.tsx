              ECOCAN D.R.S is a circular economy platform, which streamlines the

            <p>
              This is achieved by creating a marketplace for used empties, by
              conveniently connecting ECO-Producers and ECO-Recyclers seeking to
              ‘buy’ empties for reuse or recycling, with ECOnsumers who have the
